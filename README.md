## About the application

It is an application that manages your time.
 The application will allow you to add tasks (each has a title and description),
  and to add detailed operations that are needed to complete a given task.
```plaintext
Example:
The task may be "Grandma's birthday", with the description "Grandma Sofia turns 70 this year!". The operations will be:
- buy birthday decorations - 15m
- decorate the living room - 1h 15m
- bake a cake - 1h
- to prepare food - 3h
- invite the family - 15m
```

By clicking the "+ 15m" or "+ 1h" buttons, we will add the time to the counter that is available for each operation.

When the task is completed, we can mark it as finished by clicking "Finish". 
The completed task is read-only - we will not add any new operations or time to the current operations.
 They also cannot be removed.

Tasks can be deleted at any time.
